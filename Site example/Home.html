                This is an Object orineted programming language which is known as Python.Python is a high-level,
                general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
                significant indentation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0,
                released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
                2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2

        Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
        Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception
        handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.
        <br><br>
        Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he
        announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title
        the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
        decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to
        lead the project.
